# LSE TIDM to Twitter Accounts

This is a simple mapping of LSE symbols (i.e. Barc) to their respective twitter accounts (i.e. @barclays, @baclaysukhelp).

The list is based on the [April 2019 listing from the LSE](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/statistics/companies-and-issuers/instruments-defined-by-mifir-identifiers-list-on-lse.xlsx). It is still incomplete, so feel free to add twitter handles to each company.
